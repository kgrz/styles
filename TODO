* Copy styles from tips to this repo
* Add a grunt task that would minify and gzip CSS
* Another task that would publish the styles to S3. When the file gets
  saved on S3, it should add that entry to a file named `url` under each
  target repo. This will be read by nanoc when the deploy happens.


  There is one complication here. When the blog/website is deployed, the
  npm package is fetched from the git repository. So when a change is
  made to CSS, it has to be ensured that those are pushed to GH *before*
  the website/blog is deployed. And potentially, for every change in CSS
  in this repo, the blog has to be redeployed. That can be another task.

  That is, when the styles are changed here, and the PR gets merged
  to master on this repo's upstream, it will trigger a hook that will
  re-deploy the blog. And that will ensure that the changes made here
  are picked up.


On tips side:

In development env, the CSS to be used will be fetched locally.
In production env, the CSS to be used should be picked up from the
`styles` repo's S3 urls.
